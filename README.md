# No Gold For You!
_No Gold For You!_ is a lighthearted puzzle-stealth game where your goal is to cause as much destruction as possible in gold mineshafts scattered with working miners.
Act as a miner, place your bombs, watch the time, and most importantly - don't get caught!

The game's technical features have been mostly implemented but it currently does not include any levels or visuals.

## Game Overview (Planned)
You play as a saboteur planning to destroy different mineshafts, equiped with a pickaxe and a limited supply of bombs. Your goal is to place the bombs in a way that would cause as much destruction as possible, while avoiding the wandering miners and getting out before the bombs explode.

### Core mechanics
- **Strategic Bomb Placement**: Distribute your bombs wisely to maximize destruction.
- **Time Limit**: Each level has a timer, if it reaches 0 before you get out... ***Kaboom!***
- **Pickaxe**: You can hold it, you can mine with it... that's pretty much it.
- **Miners**: Miners wander around and do their job. They will mind their own business as long as you fit in.
- **Suspicion**: The more suspicious you act, the more suspicious you get. Simple as that.

#### Suspicion bar
A suspicioun bar will appear in the corner of the screen showing how suspicious the miners are of you.

- Level 0 - Miners will leave you alone as long as you hold your pickaxe
- Level 1 - Miners will follow you until you to start mining
- Level 2 - Miners will follow you until you mine a piece of gold and dump it in a gold crate
- Level 3 - You don't want to get to this level. Trust me.

#### Losing conditions
- Time's up - The bombs exploded before you could get out. Use remote bombs next time duh!
- Busted - You got way too suspicious with your bombs. Try not to.
- Try Harder - You managed to get out in time without getting caught. Too bad you didn't explode anything in the process.
